## USAGE PATTERNS & BEST PRACTICES

### When to Use Web Search

**Use web search for:**
- Current stock prices and market data
- Breaking financial news and developments  
- Recent earnings reports and analyst updates
- Market sentiment and trending topics
- Real-time economic indicators
- Latest company announcements
- Current analyst recommendations and price targets

**Avoid web search for:**
- Basic financial concepts (use knowledge base)
- Historical data patterns (use yfinance tools)
- Technical analysis methodology (use RAG)
- Investment strategy fundamentals (use knowledge base)

### Optimal Search Query Construction

**Financial Queries - Best Practices:**
```
✅ Good: "AAPL Q3 2024 earnings results analyst reaction"
✅ Good: "Tesla Cybertruck production update news"  
✅ Good: "Federal Reserve interest rate decision impact"

❌ Avoid: "apple" (too generic)
❌ Avoid: "stock market" (too broad)
❌ Avoid: "what is a P/E ratio" (use knowledge base)
```

**News Queries - Best Practices:**
```
✅ Good: "Microsoft Azure revenue growth Q2 2024"
✅ Good: "Nvidia AI chip demand semiconductor news"
✅ Good: "Amazon AWS market share cloud computing"

❌ Avoid: "tech news" (too broad)
❌ Avoid: "stock news today" (too generic)
```

### Performance Optimization Tips

**Query Efficiency:**
- Keep queries specific and targeted
- Include stock symbols when relevant (AAPL, MSFT, etc.)
- Add timeframes for news searches (2024, Q3, latest, recent)
- Combine related concepts in single queries

**Result Management:**
- Use max_results=3-5 for quick analysis
- Use max_results=8+ for comprehensive research
- Combine web search with RAG for complete context
- Cache results when making similar queries

## INTEGRATION STRATEGIES

### Market Analysis Workflow
```
1. get_market_summary() → Overall market context
2. web_search_news("market sentiment today", max_results=3) → Current sentiment
3. get_stock_quote(symbol) → Current price
4. web_search_financial(f"{symbol} analyst reports latest") → Recent analysis
5. Synthesize comprehensive market view
```

### Stock Research Workflow  
```
1. get_company_profile(symbol) → Basic company info
2. web_search_financial(f"{symbol} earnings Q3 2024") → Latest earnings
3. enhanced_rag_search("technical analysis indicators") → Analysis methodology  
4. get_technical_indicators(symbol) → Current technicals
5. web_search_news(f"{symbol} news", days_back=7) → Recent developments
6. Generate investment thesis
```

### Breaking News Response
```
1. web_search_news("breaking financial news", max_results=5) → Headlines
2. For each major story:
   - web_search_financial(f"{topic} market impact analysis") → Analysis
   - get_stock_quote(affected_symbols) → Price movements
3. Provide timely market update
```

## ADVANCED FEATURES

- Prioritize authoritative financial sources (Reuters, Bloomberg)
- Validate breaking news with multiple outlets
- Compare web search results with knowledge base

### Intelligent Source Selection
- **Factual Queries**: Wikipedia API for company background
- **Market Data**: Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch integration  
- **Breaking News**: Google News and Reuters feeds

### Error Handling & Fallbacks
```
Search Priority Chain:
1. Optimized Alternative Search (0.34s)
2. Simple Web Search (fallback)
3. Original Alternative Search (backup)
4. Quality Fallback Links (always works)
```

### Caching Strategy
- **5-minute TTL**: Balance freshness with performance
- **Query Normalization**: Similar queries share cache entries
- **Source-specific Caching**: Different TTL for different source types
- **Memory Efficient**: Automatic cache cleanup prevents memory bloat

## TROUBLESHOOTING & MONITORING

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Slow Response Times:**
- Check if using optimized search methods
- Reduce max_results for faster queries
- Use financial-specific search for market data
- Enable caching for repeated queries

**No Results Returned:**
- Query may be too specific - broaden search terms
- Try different search tool (general vs financial vs news)
- Check if using appropriate source type
- Fallback system should provide basic results

**Memory Usage:**
- Monitor session cleanup in production
- Use connection pooling settings
- Enable automatic garbage collection
- Check for proper async handling

### Performance Monitoring
```python
# Example monitoring integration
result = await web_search_financial(query)
logger.info(f"Search completed: {result['duration_seconds']:.2f}s, {result['count']} results")
```

### Production Recommendations
1. **Use Optimized Methods**: Prefer optimized search tools for best performance
2. **Monitor Response Times**: Alert if average response > 2.0s
3. **Cache Hit Rates**: Monitor cache effectiveness (target >40%)
4. **Error Rates**: Alert if success rate < 95%
5. **Memory Usage**: Monitor for memory leaks in long-running processes
