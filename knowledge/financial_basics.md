# Financial Analysis Fundamentals (Concise)

This page summarizes key definitions only. For actionable answers, prefer tools documented in tool_usage.md.

## Core ratios
- **P/E** = Price / EPS. Higher often implies growth expectations; compare within sector.
- **P/B** = Price / Book Value per Share. Useful for asset-heavy firms; context-dependent.
- **ROE** = Net Income / Shareholders' Equity. Higher suggests efficient use of equity.

## Risk metrics (see get_risk_assessment tool)
- **Volatility (annualized)**: derived from daily returns.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: risk-adjusted return vs risk-free rate.
- **Max Drawdown**: worst peak-to-trough decline.
- **VaR (95%)**: daily loss threshold at 5% tail.
- **Beta**: sensitivity vs benchmark (e.g., SPY = 1.0 baseline).

## Analysis styles
- **Technical**: moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands â€“ use sparingly for summaries.
- **Fundamental**: earnings, revenue growth, margins, leverage, competitive position.

Prefer minimal context; fetch data via tools and summarize briefly.
