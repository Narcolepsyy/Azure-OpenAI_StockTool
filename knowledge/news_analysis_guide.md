## NEWS-DRIVEN TRADING STRATEGIES

### Momentum Trading Support
**News Momentum Identification**
- Track breaking news velocity (news frequency increase)
- Measure sentiment intensity and direction changes
- Correlate news volume with price movement patterns
- Identify confirmation signals from multiple sources

**Technical Confirmation Integration**
```python
# Combine news sentiment with technical analysis
news_sentiment = web_search_news(f"{symbol} news sentiment", days_back=3)
technical_signals = get_technical_indicators(symbol, indicators=["rsi_14", "macd"])
price_action = get_historical_prices(symbol, period="5d", interval="1h")
# Correlate news timing with price movements and technical breakouts
```

### Risk Management Enhancement
**News-Based Risk Assessment**
- Monitor negative sentiment accumulation
- Track regulatory and legal news developments
- Identify potential market-moving events (earnings, FDA approvals, etc.)
- Assess geopolitical risks affecting specific sectors

**Early Warning System**
```python
# Risk monitoring workflow  
risk_keywords = ["lawsuit", "investigation", "regulatory", "recall", "guidance cut"]
for keyword in risk_keywords:
    risk_news = web_search_news(f"{symbol} {keyword}", days_back=30)
    # Analyze frequency and severity of risk-related news
```

## SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES

### Multi-Dimensional Sentiment Scoring
**Sentiment Factors**
1. **Headline Sentiment**: Primary emotional indicator
2. **Source Authority**: Reuters/Bloomberg weighted higher than social media
3. **Recency Decay**: Recent news has higher impact
4. **Volume Factor**: Multiple sources confirm sentiment direction
5. **Market Correlation**: Historical sentiment-price relationship

**Sentiment Aggregation Formula**
```
Composite Sentiment Score = 
  (Headline_Sentiment × Source_Weight × Recency_Factor × Volume_Factor) 
  / Total_Weight_Sum
  
Where:
- Headline_Sentiment: -1.0 to +1.0
- Source_Weight: 0.5 to 1.0 (Reuters=1.0, Blogs=0.5)
- Recency_Factor: 1.0 (today) to 0.1 (30 days ago)
- Volume_Factor: sqrt(article_count) capped at 3.0
```

### Sentiment Trend Analysis
**Trend Identification**
- **Improving**: Sentiment score increasing over time
- **Deteriorating**: Sentiment score declining over time
- **Stable**: Consistent sentiment with low volatility
- **Volatile**: Rapid sentiment changes requiring monitoring

**Trend Calculation**
```python
# Calculate 7-day sentiment trend
dates = [today - timedelta(days=i) for i in range(7)]
daily_sentiment = []
for date in dates:
    news = web_search_news(f"{symbol} news", days_back=1, date_filter=date)
    sentiment = calculate_sentiment_score(news)
    daily_sentiment.append(sentiment)

trend = linear_regression_slope(daily_sentiment)
# Positive trend = Improving sentiment, Negative trend = Deteriorating
```

## SPECIALIZED NEWS ANALYSIS

### Japanese Market Intelligence
**Nikkei-Specific Analysis**
```python
# Comprehensive Japanese market news
nikkei_sentiment = get_nikkei_news_with_sentiment(limit=5)
japanese_market = get_market_indices(region="japan")  
global_context = web_search_news("Japan economy policy Bank of Japan", days_back=7)
# Combine for complete Japanese market intelligence
```

**Cultural and Language Considerations**
- Sentiment analysis adapted for Japanese business culture
- Policy implications from Bank of Japan and government actions
- Cross-cultural market sentiment interpretation
- Regional economic indicators and their global impact

### Regulatory and Policy News
**Policy Impact Analysis**
```python
# Monitor regulatory developments
fed_policy = web_search_news("Federal Reserve interest rate policy", days_back=14)
sec_news = web_search_news("SEC regulatory changes financial markets", days_back=30)
international_policy = web_search_news("central bank policy global", days_back=21)
# Assess policy impact on different market sectors
```

**Compliance and Legal Monitoring**
- Track SEC enforcement actions and regulatory changes
- Monitor international regulatory developments
- Identify compliance risks for specific sectors
- Analyze policy change market impact patterns

## INTEGRATION WITH FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

### News-Enhanced Fundamental Analysis
**Earnings Context Integration**
```python
# Traditional earnings analysis enhanced with news context
financials = get_financials(symbol, freq="quarterly")
earnings_news = web_search_news(f"{symbol} earnings analysis outlook", days_back=5)
analyst_updates = web_search_financial(f"{symbol} analyst recommendations upgrade")
# Combine quantitative data with qualitative market reaction
```

**Competitive Intelligence**
```python
# Industry competitive landscape analysis
industry_news = web_search_news(f"{industry} competition market share", days_back=30)
competitor_analysis = web_search_financial(f"{competitors} vs {symbol} comparison")
sector_trends = web_search_news(f"{sector} trends outlook 2024", days_back=60)
# Generate competitive positioning report
```

### Technical Analysis Enhancement
**News-Technical Correlation**
```python
# Correlate news events with technical patterns
news_events = web_search_news(f"{symbol} news", days_back=30)
price_history = get_historical_prices(symbol, period="1mo", interval="1d")
technical_indicators = get_technical_indicators(symbol, period="1mo")
# Identify news-driven technical breakouts and reversals
```

**Market Timing Optimization**
- Use news sentiment to confirm technical signals
- Identify news-driven volume spikes and their implications
