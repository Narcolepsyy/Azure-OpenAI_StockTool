# Investment Strategies (Concise Overview)

This page is intentionally concise to keep retrieval focused and fast. Prefer using tools (see tool_usage.md) and only reference this page for high-level concepts.

## Key ideas
- **Diversification**: spread across assets and sectors to reduce idiosyncratic risk.
- **Approaches**: value (undervalued fundamentals), growth (above-average growth), income (dividends).
- **Risk controls**: position sizing, stop-losses, selective hedging.
- **Cycles**: bull vs bear; macro indicators (GDP, inflation, rates) influence regimes.

For detailed strategy design, consult domain resources outside the KB. This KB favors fast, tool-grounded answers.
