## Web Source Citation System Summary

### 🎯 System Overview

Your `PerplexityWebSearchService` implements a robust citation system that properly attributes web sources in AI-generated answers, similar to how academic papers cite references.

### 🔍 How Citations Work

#### 1. **Source Collection & Assignment**
```python
# Each search result gets a unique citation ID
SearchResult(
    title="Tesla Stock Analysis",
    url="https://example.com/tesla-analysis", 
    citation_id=1,  # Automatically assigned
    relevance_score=0.8
)
```

#### 2. **Citation Integration in AI Answers**
The AI synthesis process includes citations like `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]` throughout the generated answer:
```text
Tesla's stock price has risen 15% this quarter [1], driven by strong 
Model 3 sales [2] and positive analyst forecasts [3].
```

#### 3. **Citation Mapping**
```python
citations = {
    1: "Tesla Stock Analysis - finance.yahoo.com",
    2: "Q3 Sales Report - reuters.com", 
    3: "Analyst Forecasts - marketwatch.com"
}
```

### 📊 Test Results Verification

### 🔧 Key Implementation Features

#### **Enhanced Relevance Filtering**
```python
def _is_result_relevant(self, query: str, title: str, snippet: str) -> bool:
    # Filters out irrelevant results (medical, sports, entertainment)
    # Prioritizes financial/stock content for financial queries
    # Supports both English and Japanese queries
```

#### **Mandatory Citation Prompting**
```python
synthesis_prompt = """
CRITICAL CITATION REQUIREMENTS:
- You MUST use citations [1], [2], [3], etc. for EVERY factual claim
- Citations should correspond to the source numbers in the search results
- Include multiple citations per paragraph when drawing from different sources
"""
```

#### **Multi-Language Support**
- Handles Japanese financial terms: `銀行`, `金融`, `株式`, `投資`
- Provides translations when needed
- Maintains citation accuracy across languages

### 🌐 Usage Examples

result = perplexity_web_search(
    query="Microsoft MSFT stock analysis 2024",
    max_results=5,
    synthesize_answer=True
)

print(f"Answer: {result['answer']}")
print(f"Citations: {result['citations']}")
print(f"Sources: {len(result['sources'])}")
```
