# Streaming Response Test Results

**Test Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Endpoint:** `/chat/stream`  
**Overall Grade:** B- (Streaming works, but has performance issues)

## Executive Summary

✅ **Streaming functionality is WORKING**  
⚠️ **Performance concerns detected**  
❌ **Cache and error handling need attention**

The streaming endpoint successfully delivers real-time responses in SSE format with proper event typing. However, tool calls exceed timeout targets, and cache hit performance is slower than expected.

---

## Test Results

### Test 1: Simple Streaming Response ✅ PASS
**Query:** "What is 2+2? Be brief."  
**Model:** gpt-4o-mini

**Metrics:**
- Duration: 1.36s
- Time to First Byte (TTFB): 1363ms
- Chunks received: 10
- Content length: 15 chars

**Validation:** 6/6 passed
- ✅ Received chunks
- ✅ First chunk fast (< 5s)
- ✅ Total time reasonable (< 10s)
- ✅ Has content
- ✅ Has start event
- ✅ Has done event

**Assessment:** Excellent performance for simple queries. TTFB of 1.4s is acceptable for LLM streaming.

---

### Test 2: Tool Call Streaming ❌ FAIL
**Query:** "What is Apple's stock price?"  
**Model:** gpt-4o-mini

**Metrics:**
- Duration: 25.30s ⚠️ (target: < 15s)
- TTFB: 4920ms (4.9s)
- Chunks received: 7
- Tool calls: 2 (perplexity_search)
- Content length: 671 chars

**Validation:** 5/6 passed
- ✅ Received chunks
- ✅ First chunk fast (< 5s)
- ❌ **Total time exceeded 15s target**
- ✅ Has content
- ✅ Tool calls detected
- ✅ Has done event

**Issues:**
1. **Perplexity search took ~20s** - web search is the bottleneck
2. Stock price tool might have failed (used web search fallback)
3. Total response time 68% over target

**Tool Activity:**
```
perplexity_search: running
perplexity_search: completed
```

**Response Analysis:**
The AI fell back to perplexity_search instead of using `get_stock_quote`, which should be faster. The search synthesis took 20+ seconds, likely due to:
- Web scraping overhead
- Multiple search sources (Brave + DDGS)
- LLM synthesis step
- Network latency

---

### Test 3: Cached Response Streaming ❌ FAIL
**Query:** "What is 2+2? Be brief." (repeat)  
**Model:** gpt-4o-mini

**Metrics:**
- Duration: 3.10s ⚠️ (target: < 2s)
- TTFB: 3097ms ⚠️ (target: < 100ms)
- Cached: False ❌
- Chunks received: 10

**Validation:** 1/3 passed
- ✅ Received chunks
- ❌ Not fast enough for cached response
- ❌ TTFB not instant

**Issues:**
1. **Cache miss** - Response cache may be disabled or TTL expired
2. **Re-generated response** - No performance benefit from caching
3. **TTFB slower than first run** - 3.1s vs 1.4s (225% slower)

**Root Cause:**
Either:
- Response caching is disabled in config
- Cache key mismatch (different conversation_id?)
- TTL too short (< 2 minutes between tests)
- Cache invalidation issue

---

### Test 4: Error Handling ❌ FAIL
**Query:** Invalid model name  
**Expected:** HTTP error or error event

**Result:** No error received

**Issues:**
1. Invalid model name did not trigger error response
2. System may have fallen back to default model silently
3. No error event in stream

**Expected Behavior:**
- HTTP 400/422 for invalid model
- OR error event in stream: `{"type": "error", "error": "..."}`

## Performance Analysis

### Response Time Distribution
| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Average response time | 9.92s | < 10s | ✅ Pass |
| Fastest response | 1.36s | < 5s | ✅ Excellent |
| Slowest response | 25.30s | < 15s | ❌ Fail |
| Average TTFB | 3.13s | < 3s | ⚠️ Acceptable |
| Best TTFB | 1.36s | < 2s | ✅ Good |

### Streaming Performance
- **SSE Format:** ✅ Correct (`data: {...}\n\n`)
- **Event Types:** ✅ start, content, tool_call, tools_called, done
- **Tool Feedback:** ✅ Real-time tool status updates
- **Chunking:** ✅ Incremental content delivery
- **Error Handling:** ❌ Not working properly

---

## Issues Identified

### Critical Issues
1. **Cache Not Working** - Cached responses showing same latency as fresh requests
2. **Error Handling Broken** - Invalid models not rejected properly
3. **Tool Call Timeout** - Perplexity search exceeds 15s target by 68%

### Performance Issues
1. **Cached TTFB 30x slower than expected** - 3.1s vs 100ms target
2. **Tool calls slow** - 25s total, mostly in web search
3. **TTFB variability** - 1.4s to 4.9s range

### Minor Issues
1. Stock quote tool not being called (web search used instead)
2. No tool call optimization for stock queries

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

#### 1. Fix Response Cache
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Impact:** 95% latency reduction for repeat queries

Check `app/services/memory_service.py`:
```python
# Verify cache is enabled
RESPONSE_CACHE_ENABLED = True

# Check cache key generation
def get_cache_key(prompt: str, model: str) -> str:
    # Should normalize prompt and exclude conversation_id
```

**Expected:** 0.1s TTFB for cached responses (not 3.1s)

#### 2. Implement Error Handling
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Impact:** User experience and debugging

In `app/routers/chat.py`:
```python
@router.post("/stream")
async def chat_stream_endpoint(...):
    # Validate model before streaming
    if deployment not in AVAILABLE_MODELS:
        raise HTTPException(400, "Invalid model")
    
    # Wrap stream in try/except
    try:
        async for chunk in generate_stream():
            yield chunk
    except Exception as e:
        yield f"data: {json.dumps({'type': 'error', 'error': str(e)})}\n\n"
```

#### 3. Optimize Web Search
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** 40% reduction in tool call latency

Target: 10s for perplexity_search (not 20s)

Options:
- Reduce search timeout from 30s to 15s
- Use faster model for synthesis (gpt-4o-mini not gpt-oss-120b)
- Limit search results to top 3 (not top 5)
- Skip semantic ranking for speed

#### 4. Fix Tool Selection
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Better tool routing for stock queries

Stock price queries should call `get_stock_quote` (0.5s), not `perplexity_search` (20s).

Improve tool selection logic:
```python
# In tool injection, boost stock tools for ticker queries
if re.search(r'\b[A-Z]{1,5}\b.*stock.*price', query):
    # Force include get_stock_quote
```

## Conclusion

### What's Working ✅
- Streaming delivery mechanism (SSE format)
- Event typing and structure
- Real-time tool feedback
- Simple query performance (1.4s)
- Content chunking

### What Needs Fixing ❌
- Response caching (not working at all)
- Error handling (invalid models accepted)
- Tool call performance (68% over target)
- Stock tool routing (using slow fallback)

### Overall Assessment
**Grade: B-**

The streaming functionality **works correctly** and delivers a good user experience for simple queries. However, performance degrades significantly for tool-heavy queries, and critical features like caching and error handling are broken.

**Primary Bottleneck:** Web search synthesis (20s out of 25s total)

**Recommended Action:** Fix caching first (biggest impact), then optimize web search timeouts.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate cache failure** - Why isn't the cache being hit?
2. **Add model validation** - Reject invalid models before streaming
3. **Profile tool calls** - Where is the 20s being spent?
4. **Test with stock tools** - Verify `get_stock_quote` is faster than web search
5. **Monitor production** - Add metrics to track TTFB and cache hit rate

**Target Performance:**
- Simple queries: < 2s (currently 1.4s ✅)
- Tool queries: < 10s (currently 25s ❌)
- Cached queries: < 0.2s (currently 3.1s ❌)
- Error handling: Works (currently broken ❌)

**Priority Order:**
1. Fix caching (95% improvement potential)
2. Fix error handling (critical for production)
3. Optimize web search (40% improvement)
4. Improve tool routing (2x faster for stock queries)
