# üßπ LocalStack Resource Cleanup Guide

## Should You Clean Resources When Complete?

**Short Answer**: It depends on what you're doing!

---

## üéØ When to KEEP Resources (Don't Clean Up)

### ‚úÖ Portfolio/Demo Mode (Recommended for You Now)

**Keep resources running if you're**:
- Creating demo videos
- Taking screenshots
- Showing to recruiters/interviewers
- Working on documentation
- Testing your application

**Why**: Resources are ready instantly, no setup time needed

```bash
# Keep LocalStack running
docker compose ps  # Should show "Up"

# Resources available immediately:
# ‚úì Lambda functions deployed
# ‚úì CloudWatch dashboards visible
# ‚úì DynamoDB tables populated
# ‚úì S3 buckets ready
# ‚úì Everything ready for demo!
```

---

### ‚úÖ Active Development Mode

**Keep resources if you're**:
- Making code changes
- Testing features
- Debugging issues
- Running the app frequently (daily/hourly)

**Why**: Redeploying takes 2-3 minutes each time

---

## üßπ When to CLEAN Resources

### 1. ‚ùå Done for the Day/Week

**Clean up when**:
- Finished working on project
- Won't use for several days
- Need to free up system resources
- Done with interviews/demos

**How to clean**:

```bash
# Option A: Stop LocalStack (keeps data)
docker compose stop localstack

# Later, restart with same data:
docker compose start localstack

# Option B: Stop and remove (deletes data)
docker compose down

# Later, full restart needed:
docker compose up -d localstack
./scripts/deploy_lambda.sh
./scripts/create_cloudwatch_dashboard.sh
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Free RAM: ~500 MB - 1 GB
- ‚úÖ Free CPU: Stops background processes
- ‚úÖ Free disk I/O: No LocalStack activity

---

### 2. ‚ùå Testing Clean Deployment

**Clean up when**:
- Testing deployment scripts
- Verifying automation works
- Creating tutorial/documentation
- Ensuring reproducibility

**How**:
```bash
# Full cleanup
docker compose down -v  # Remove volumes (all data lost!)

# Fresh start
docker compose up -d localstack
./scripts/deploy_lambda.sh
./scripts/create_cloudwatch_dashboard.sh

# Verify everything works from scratch
python scripts/verify_aws_resources.py
```

---

### 3. ‚ùå System Performance Issues

**Clean up when**:
- Computer running slow
- Low on RAM (<4 GB free)
- Low on disk space
- Docker consuming too much CPU

**Check resource usage**:
```bash
# See Docker resource usage
docker stats

# Example output:
CONTAINER     CPU %    MEM USAGE / LIMIT     MEM %
localstack    2.5%     850MiB / 8GiB        10.4%

# If >50% CPU or >2 GB RAM, consider stopping
```

---

## üìä Resource Usage Comparison

### LocalStack Running (Current State)
```
RAM:        ~500 MB - 1 GB
CPU:        ~2-5% (idle), up to 50% (active)
Disk:       ~200 MB (data + cache)
Network:    Minimal (local only)

Impact:     Laptop battery drains 10-15% faster
            Slight fan noise on older machines
```

### LocalStack Stopped
```
RAM:        0 MB (freed)
CPU:        0% (freed)
Disk:       ~50 MB (Docker images only)
Network:    None

Impact:     No battery drain
            Silent operation
            Other apps run faster
```

## üé¨ Your Current Situation (Demo Video Mode)

### Recommendation: **KEEP Resources Running** ‚úÖ

**Why**:
1. You're creating demo videos ‚Üí Need instant access
2. Working on documentation ‚Üí Need to show screenshots
3. Portfolio showcase mode ‚Üí Keep everything ready
4. Resources are lightweight ‚Üí Not causing issues

**What to keep**:
```bash
# These should stay running:
‚úì docker compose up -d localstack
‚úì Lambda functions deployed
‚úì CloudWatch dashboards created
‚úì All AWS resources configured

# Optional to stop:
‚úó python main.py (FastAPI app)
  ‚Üí Only run when testing/demoing
```

---

## üîÑ Daily Workflow Recommendations

### Option A: Keep LocalStack Running (Easiest)

**Morning**:
```bash
# Check if still running
docker compose ps

# If stopped, restart
docker compose start localstack

# Verify resources
python scripts/verify_aws_resources.py
```

**During work**:
```bash
# Work normally
# Resources always available
```

**Evening**:
```bash
# Leave running (recommended)
# OR stop to save battery:
docker compose stop localstack
```

**Benefits**: Zero setup time, instant access  
**Drawbacks**: Uses ~500 MB RAM constantly

---

### Option B: Start/Stop Daily (Most Efficient)

**Morning**:
```bash
# Start fresh
docker compose up -d localstack

# Wait 10 seconds
sleep 10

# Quick redeploy (automated)
./scripts/deploy_lambda.sh
./scripts/create_cloudwatch_dashboard.sh
```

**Evening**:
```bash
# Stop and clean
docker compose down

# OR keep data:
docker compose stop localstack
```

**Benefits**: Saves resources when not working  
**Drawbacks**: 2-3 minute setup each morning

docker compose stop localstack   # Evening
docker compose start localstack  # Morning (keeps data!)
```

### After Portfolio Showcase Complete:

```bash
# Stop when done
docker compose down

# Restart only when needed
# (like for future demos/interviews)
```

---

## üìù Cleanup Commands Reference

### Gentle Cleanup (Keeps Data)
```bash
# Stop but keep volumes
docker compose stop localstack

# Restart later with same data
docker compose start localstack
```

### Medium Cleanup (Removes Containers)
```bash
# Remove containers but keep volumes
docker compose down

# Restart from scratch (but volumes remain)
docker compose up -d localstack
# Need to redeploy Lambda, dashboard, etc.
```

### Nuclear Cleanup (Deletes Everything)
```bash
# Remove everything including data
docker compose down -v

# Remove Docker images too
docker rmi localstack/localstack-pro:latest

# Completely fresh start
docker compose up -d localstack
./scripts/deploy_lambda.sh
./scripts/create_cloudwatch_dashboard.sh
python scripts/verify_aws_resources.py

# If available < 2 GB ‚Üí Stop LocalStack
```

---

## üìã Cleanup Checklist

Before stopping LocalStack, save what you need:

```bash
# ‚úÖ Take screenshots if needed
# ‚úÖ Export dashboard JSON (if custom changes)
# ‚úÖ Backup any test data
# ‚úÖ Note current state in documentation

# Then stop:
docker compose stop localstack

# Verify stopped:
docker compose ps  # Should show "Exited"
```

---

## üé¨ For Your Demo Video Tomorrow

### Preparation Steps:

**Tonight (Optional)**:
```bash
# Keep running OR stop to save battery
docker compose stop localstack  # Optional
```

**Tomorrow Morning (Before Recording)**:
```bash
# If stopped, start again
docker compose start localstack

# Wait for healthy
sleep 10
curl http://localhost:4566/_localstack/health

# Verify resources
python scripts/verify_aws_resources.py

# All set! ‚úÖ
```

**During Recording**:
```bash
# Everything ready instantly
# No waiting for deployment
# All resources operational
```

**After Recording**:
```bash
# Keep running for editing/retakes
# Stop only when completely done
docker compose stop localstack  # When finished
```

---

## üí∞ Cost Consideration

### LocalStack Running 24/7:
- **Cloud cost**: $0 (running locally!)
- **Electricity**: ~$0.50/month (minimal)
- **Laptop battery**: Drains 10-15% faster

### Stopping When Not Needed:
- Saves battery life
- Extends laptop lifespan
- No actual cost savings (already $0!)

**Verdict**: Cost is not a factor, decide based on convenience vs. resources

---

## ‚úÖ Final Recommendation

**For the next 2-3 days (demo video creation)**:
```bash
KEEP LOCALSTACK RUNNING ‚úÖ

Why:
- Instant access for recording
- No setup delays
- Consistent state
- Ready for retakes
```

**After portfolio showcase complete**:
```bash
STOP WHEN NOT USING ‚úÖ

Strategy:
- Stop evenings: docker compose stop localstack
