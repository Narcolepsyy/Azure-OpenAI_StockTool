curl http://localhost:4566/_localstack/health | jq

# Check license activation
curl http://localhost:4566/_localstack/info | jq
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "edition": "pro",
  "is_license_activated": true
}
```

### Verify AWS Resources
```bash
python scripts/verify_aws_resources.py
```

### Run Integration Tests
```bash
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python tests/test_aws_integration.py
```

```

### Stop LocalStack
```bash
docker compose down
```

### View Logs

docker compose restart localstack
```

### Reset All Data (Nuclear Option)

```

## Troubleshooting

### License Not Activating?

1. **Check token is loaded:**
   ```bash
   docker exec stocktool-localstack env | grep LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

2. **Verify using Pro image:**
   ```bash
   docker inspect stocktool-localstack | grep Image
   # Should show: localstack/localstack-pro
   ```

3. **Check logs for errors:**
   ```bash
   docker logs stocktool-localstack | grep -i auth
   ```

### Services Not Running?

```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl http://localhost:4566/_localstack/health

# Enable service in docker-compose.yml
environment:
  - SERVICES=s3,dynamodb,sqs,sns,lambda,cloudwatch,logs,...
```

### Port Already in Use?

```bash
# Check what's using port 4566
sudo lsof -i :4566

# Stop conflicting container
docker stop $(docker ps -q --filter "ancestor=localstack/localstack")
```

## AWS Service Endpoints

All services use the same endpoint:
```
http://localhost:4566
```

### Example boto3 Configuration
```python
import boto3

# LocalStack client
s3 = boto3.client(
    's3',
    endpoint_url='http://localhost:4566',
    aws_access_key_id='test',
    aws_secret_access_key='test',
    region_name='us-east-1'
)
```

## Resources Created in This Project

### S3 Buckets
- `stocktool-knowledge` - RAG knowledge base storage

### DynamoDB Tables
- `stocktool-conversations` - Chat conversation history (24h TTL)
- `stocktool-stock-cache` - Stock data cache (5min TTL)

### SQS Queues
- `stocktool-analysis-queue` - Async analysis tasks

### SNS Topics
- `stocktool-notifications` - System notifications

### CloudWatch Metrics
Namespace: `StockTool`
- API latency
- Tool execution time
- Cache hit rate
- Model token usage
- Model latency

## Production Deployment

When moving to real AWS:

1. **Update .env:**
   ```bash
   USE_LOCALSTACK=false
   AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=  # Leave empty
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-real-key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-real-secret
   ```

2. **No code changes needed** - Application automatically switches to real AWS

3. **Create resources in AWS:**
   - Use CloudFormation or Terraform
   - Match the resource names from LocalStack
