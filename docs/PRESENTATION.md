## üéØ Project Overview (1 minute)
**What I Built**: An AI-powered financial analysis chatbot combining Azure OpenAI with real-time stock data

**Why This Project**: 
- Demonstrates full-stack development skills (Python FastAPI + React)
- Shows AI integration capabilities 
- Addresses real-world financial data challenges
- Implements enterprise-grade compliance features

**Tech Stack**: Python FastAPI, Azure OpenAI/GPT-4, React/TypeScript, SQLAlchemy, yfinance API

## ‚ö° Key Features Demo (2 minutes)

### 1. Intelligent Stock Analysis
```
User: "What's Apple's current performance and should I be concerned?"
AI: Fetches real-time data + news + risk metrics + compliance-safe analysis
```

### 2. Multi-Modal Data Integration
- **Real-time stock prices** (yfinance API)
- **Financial news analysis** with full-text extraction
- **Risk calculations** (volatility, Sharpe ratio, VaR, drawdowns)
- **RAG-enhanced responses** using financial knowledge base

### 3. Conversation Memory
- Maintains context across multiple questions
- Conversation history management
- Multi-turn financial discussions

## üõ°Ô∏è Technical Challenges Solved (2 minutes)

### Challenge 1: Financial Compliance
**Problem**: AI models can give investment advice (regulatory risk)
**Solution**: Built automated guardrail system that:
- Detects investment advice patterns (Japanese/English)
- Automatically adds disclaimers
- Enforces data source citations
- Validates data freshness

### Challenge 2: API Integration Complexity  
**Problem**: OpenAI tool calling had validation errors
**Solution**: Implemented robust message validation ensuring tool call/response pairs are complete

### Challenge 3: Performance & Reliability
**Problem**: Multiple API calls causing latency
**Solution**: 
- Intelligent caching system
- Connection pooling
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Token budget optimization
