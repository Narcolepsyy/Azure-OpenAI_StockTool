### ✅ No Critical Issues Detected
- No timeout errors
- No parsing errors
- No citation format issues
- No event loop conflicts
- No memory leaks

## Recommendations

### ✅ DO NOT Change (Working Perfectly)

1. **Current search implementation** - Performance is excellent
2. **Synthesis timeouts (30s)** - Well-optimized
3. **Result limits (5-8 sources)** - Good balance
4. **Caching strategy** - Working perfectly
5. **Citation system** - Excellent quality
6. **Event loop handling** - No conflicts

### ⚠️ OPTIONAL Enhancements (Low Priority)

1. **Cache Pre-warming** (If needed for production)
   ```python
   # Pre-load popular queries
   popular_queries = [
       "stock market news today",
       "tech sector earnings",
       "S&P 500 analysis"
   ]
   ```

2. **Result Ranking Tuning** (If quality issues arise)
   - Current BM25 + semantic scoring is working well
   - Only tune if users report relevance issues

3. **Domain Quality Scoring** (Optional)
   - Current warning system is adequate
   - Could add automatic domain reputation scoring

### ❌ DO NOT Implement

1. ❌ **Reduce timeouts further** - Current settings optimal
2. ❌ **Increase result limits** - 5-8 is optimal for speed
3. ❌ **Remove synthesis** - Provides significant value
4. ❌ **Change caching strategy** - Working perfectly
